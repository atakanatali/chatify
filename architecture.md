## Overview
Chatify follows a modular monolith architecture with Clean Architecture boundaries and SOLID principles. This document will be expanded as modules and services are implemented.

## Solution Structure
Placeholders only. Future steps will describe the folder layout and layer responsibilities.

## Modules
Placeholders only. Future steps will outline module scopes, dependencies, and integration patterns.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
Placeholders only. Future steps will outline logging, metrics, configuration, and shared libraries.

## Infrastructure
Placeholders only. Future steps will document Kafka, Redis, Scylla, and Elastic integration.

## Testing Strategy
Placeholders only. Future steps will describe unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Operational Considerations
Placeholders only. Future steps will cover deployment and runtime considerations.

## Appendix
Placeholders only.
