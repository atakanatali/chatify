## Overview
Chatify follows a modular monolith architecture with Clean Architecture boundaries and SOLID principles. This document will be expanded as modules and services are implemented.

## Solution Structure
The Chatify solution is defined in `Chatify.sln` and follows a modular monolith layout:

- **Hosts**
  - `src/Hosts/Chatify.ChatApi`: API host that wires dependencies and exposes the HTTP surface area.
- **Shared Kernel**
  - `src/BuildingBlocks/Chatify.BuildingBlocks`: cross-cutting utilities, shared abstractions, and base types.
- **Modules**
  - `src/Modules/Chat/Chatify.Chat.Domain`: domain entities, value objects, and domain services.
  - `src/Modules/Chat/Chatify.Chat.Application`: use cases, commands/queries, and application orchestration.
  - `src/Modules/Chat/Chatify.Chat.Infrastructure`: persistence, messaging, and external integrations.
- **Tests**
  - `tests/Chatify.Chat.UnitTests`: unit tests for the chat module.
  - `tests/Chatify.ChatApi.IntegrationTests`: integration tests for the API host and module wiring.

## Modules
The Chat module is split using Clean Architecture boundaries. Dependency rules are enforced via project references:

- **Domain** depends only on `Chatify.BuildingBlocks` (when shared kernel utilities are required).
- **Application** depends on **Domain** and **BuildingBlocks**.
- **Infrastructure** depends on **Application**, **Domain**, and **BuildingBlocks**.
- **Host (ChatApi)** depends on **Application**, **Infrastructure**, and **BuildingBlocks**.

This structure keeps domain logic isolated, pushes orchestration to the application layer, and encapsulates infrastructure concerns behind the application boundary.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
Placeholders only. Future steps will outline logging, metrics, configuration, and shared libraries.

## Infrastructure
Placeholders only. Future steps will document Kafka, Redis, Scylla, and Elastic integration.

## Testing Strategy
Placeholders only. Future steps will describe unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Operational Considerations
Placeholders only. Future steps will cover deployment and runtime considerations.

## Appendix
Placeholders only.
